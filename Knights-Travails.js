// A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board 
// given enough turns Its basic move is two steps forward and one step to the side
// It can face any direction.


// this method shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
